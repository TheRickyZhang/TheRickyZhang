## Welcome to my GitHub

Hi! I'm **Ricky Zhang**, and I currently attend the University of Florida as a Computer Science/Math Major. I like building things and solving problems. Yeaaah.

### What I'm Working On
- A **Realistic Beyblade Game** â€“ can you believe one doesn't exist? Current physics engines aren't accurate enough for high-speed collisions and movement.
- Feel free to reach out if you're interested in contributing! @rickroyale (Discord)

### Interests & Skills
- Everything. Kinda. Specializing in algorithmic C++ and web development.
